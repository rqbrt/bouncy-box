Ludum Dare 30 Entry

For my second Ludum Dare, I made a simple yet challenging platformer. You play as a box that bounces and rotates around.
The goal is to start on the green tile and get to the blue tile while avoiding the spikes. Each level (there are 7 levels)
has two dimensions that you have to switch in and out of in order to complete the level. I kept the art pretty minimal
because I am terrible at drawing. The menus are also pretty bland because I didn't spend much time on them, but other than
that I had a lot of fun making this game!
